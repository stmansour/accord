#  !!!!!!! NOTICE !!!!!!!
#  There is a bug in all of cygwin shells that cause it to silently truncate
#  commands longer than about 153 characters. This was causing all the 'wget'
#  and 'curl' commands to fail, even though they would work on other OS's.
#  These commands were moved to setup-win-jenkins.bat where they are working
#  correctly. If cygwin ever fixes this, we can move the lines around.
